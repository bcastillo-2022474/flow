# Flow - Project Proposal

## Introduction

Flow is a task and project management application designed to streamline and enhance productivity for companies. Inspired by popular task management tools like Asana, Trello, and Jira, Flow provides a user-friendly interface and robust features to help teams effectively manage their tasks and projects.

This project proposal outlines the goals, features, and technologies used in the development of Flow. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the project scope and implementation.

## Goals

The primary goal of Flow is to create a comprehensive task and project management application that offers a seamless user experience and promotes efficient collaboration within teams. The specific objectives of the project include:

1. Developing a user-friendly and intuitive user interface using React.
2. Implementing a scalable and secure back-end architecture using Node.js, Express, Prisma, and MySQL.
3. Enabling task creation, tracking, and management.
4. Facilitating project creation and organization.
5. Supporting the creation and management of todo lists within tasks and projects.
6. Implementing Kanban boards for efficient task management.
7. Ensuring seamless user authentication and access control.
8. Creating a visually appealing UI inspired by Asana's mobile interface.

## Technologies Used

Flow utilizes a range of technologies to deliver its features and provide a robust user experience. The key technologies used in the project include:

- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, enabling better code quality and tooling support.
- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based approach for creating interactive UIs.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows server-side execution of JavaScript code, enabling server-side rendering and handling API requests.
- Express: A flexible and minimalistic web application framework for Node.js, providing a foundation for building robust APIs.
- Prisma: A modern database toolkit that simplifies database access and management, enabling seamless integration with the MySQL database.
- MySQL: A widely used relational database management system that offers scalability and reliability for data storage and retrieval.
- HTML5 and CSS3: Standard web technologies for structuring and styling the application's user interface.

## Features that must be implemented

Flow aims to provide a comprehensive set of features to support effective task and project management. The key features include:

1. Task Management: Users can create, update, and track tasks, assign them to team members, set deadlines, and mark their progress.
2. Project Management: Users and Organizations are gonna be able to create projects, assign tasks to projects, and organize project-related information in a centralized manner.
3. Todo Lists: Users are gonna be able to create and manage todo lists within tasks and projects, enabling better organization and task prioritization.
4. Kanban Boards: Flow must emphasize the use of Kanban boards, allowing users to visualize and manage their tasks in a Kanban-style workflow.
5. User Authentication: Flow must provide secure user authentication and access control to ensure data privacy and protect sensitive information.

# Flow (Front-end)

This repository contains the front-end code for Flow, The application is being developed as a full stack solution, with the back-end code residing in a separate repository, for more information of the backend, refer to (this repositoritory)[https://github.com/bcastillo-2022474/job-board-backend].
